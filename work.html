              Learning advanced techniques to create a weather app was
              exhilarating! Using a weather API that SheCodes constructed to
              integrate with the Vanilla JavaScript project was gratifying. Take
              a few minutes and explore the weather in different cities in this
              fully-functional weather app!

              With a love of travel and spending much time in different time
              zones, it was thrilling to build a world clock! I wanted to try
              and touch the 24 regions of time and create an app relevant to
              specific departments in the federal government. Incorporating APIs
              is always stimulating, furthermore, this project was challenging
              and rewarding! Allow yourself a moment to be taken through time
              and enjoy my world clock!

              This was the very first project that I ever built! Looking back at
              how much knowledge and skills I have learned over the last several
              months, I am just amazed. Loving my life of building and creating
              and the ability to share a little piece of something personal and
              remarkable while learning was a great opportunity. I hope you
              enjoy reading about my Alaskan Malamutes Mini and Finn!

              This landing page was exciting to build, as it combined my passion
              for yoga and teaching with my newly acquired skills as a coder
              with images and rows! Again, it's fun to look back and see my
              progress, as this was an add-on project and only the second page I
              ever attempted to build. I hope this page brings you a little
              peace and insight!
